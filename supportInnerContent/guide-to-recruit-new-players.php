However, help is at hand in the form of Airport Hotels, where you can spend a relaxed evening – and even afford an extra hour or two in bed before leaving.</p>

In many peoples mind they are ranked alongside train station pubs – filled with chain smoking business men in cheap suits. However, while there is certainly a convincing argument to avoid train station pubs (you have to pay to get in the toilet for starters), airport hotels are a long way from their cheap and not-so-cheerful roots. These days the savvy traveller can pick up a great value deal at some excellent hotel accommodation situated close to their airport of departure.</p>
